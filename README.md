In the time I have before grad school, I have decided to create an application which enables a user to evaluate certain investment opportunities and assets. 

I have always struggled with evalauting ivestments, and the tools provided online were either biased, paid, or difficult to understand. 

Currently the application only offers pre-defined calculations and graphical displays, but I plan to incorporate features pertaining to topics I find interesting. I want to try including a robo-advisor powered by a nueral network trained on TensorFlow.
